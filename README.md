## Contributing Guide:

### All Contributions Are Reviewed!
We welcome contributions but ask that you follow these guidelines:

1. **No Stolen Code ('Skidding')**: Ensure that all contributions are original. We do not accept code taken from other projects (e.g., LawinserverV2).
   
2. **Focus on Incremental Changes**: As this is also a learning project, I ask that you avoid making overly complex or significant changes that are beyond my current level of understanding. Smaller, meaningful changes are appreciated!

3. **Avoid Deleting Core Code**: Please refrain from removing large portions of the existing codebase. Certain sections may be integral to the backendâ€™s functionality, and deleting them could break core features.

### Tips for Contributing:
- **Create a New Branch**: Always create a new branch for your contributions (e.g., `feature/[feature-name]`).
- **Submit Small Changes**: Small bug fixes, improvements in documentation, and new features are highly encouraged.
- **Respect the Learning Process**: Keep changes manageable and easy to review to help keep the project maintainable.

Thank you for contributing to the project!
